                    <p>While I've always considered myself technically savvy, i didn't consider switching to a technically-focused career until after 8 years of HR and Recruiting. I am proud to say, as of May 27th 2020, I have graduated a Full Stack Developer boot camp at General Assembly, and am capable of associate-level programming.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of my Recruiting career (2017-2020), I was lucky enough to be able to recruit for a variety of AAA game studios, where I ended up placing dozens of game and software developers. I believe it was during this time that I realized a couple things about programming:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>There's a whole lot more room for creativity than I imagined.</li>
                            <li>You don't have to be a mathematical genius for the majority of coding projects.</li>
                            <li>You can make a LOT of money, if you're good at it.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>Another discovery I made while programming, as a part of my coding boot camp, was how much programming reinforces one's ability to be self-sufficient. There won't always be someone to show you how to do something and, in programming, you will often find yourself in a situation where you must research and solve whatever issue you're facing on your own. This is an incredible gift and I am very grateful for the newfound love for exploration and self-sufficiency that programming has instilled in me.</p>
