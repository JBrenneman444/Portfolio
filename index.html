                    <p>While I've always considered myself technically savvy, i didn't consider switching to a technically-focused career until after 8 years of HR and Recruiting. I am proud to say, as of May 27th 2020, I have graduated a Full Stack Developer boot camp at General Assembly, and am capable of associate-level programming.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of my Recruiting career (2017-2020), I was lucky enough to be able to recruit for a variety of AAA game studios, where I ended up placing dozens of game and software developers. I believe it was during this time that I realized a couple things about programming:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>There's a whole lot more room for creativity than I imagined.</li>
                            <li>You don't have to be a mathematical genius for the majority of coding projects.</li>
                            <li>You can make a LOT of money, if you're good at it.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>Another discovery I made while programming, as a part of my coding boot camp, was how much programming reinforces one's ability to be self-sufficient. There won't always be someone to show you how to do something and, in programming, you will often find yourself in a situation where you must research and solve whatever issue you're facing on your own. This is an incredible gift and I am very grateful for the newfound love for exploration and self-sufficiency that programming has instilled in me.</p>

                        <li>Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, Mongoose (one-to-many), MongoLab, React Bootstrap, SASS.</li>
                        <li>Tasked with learning and using a new technology, and enabling CRUD functionality - I chose React Bootstrap.</li>
                        <li>Implemented fully functional CRUD routes (the Update route is executed by double-clicking a message).</li>
                        <li>Taught myself how to successfully connect two collections in Mongoose via a one-to-many relationship.</li>
                        <li>Figuring out how to structure React Bootstrap's form commponents while passing down and lifting state was challenging.</li>
                        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Originally, I wanted to be able to send messages OR pictures. I need to have it send messages by default and remove the form field.</li>

                        <li>I played the role of Product Manager and supervised the enabling of the various user stories my team agreed upon. We successfully enabled the requirements for our class project but, when pushed to Heroku, we lost functionality to our CRUD routes and the team has not worked on it, since.</li>
                        <li>I contributed at least 50% of the styling.</li>
                        <li>I created the logo.</li>

                        <li>Eventually, ended up creating a whole new model which allowed me to query it specifically. This aspect of the assignment was th emost challenging for me.</li></li>
