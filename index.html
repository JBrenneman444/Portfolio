                    <p>While I always considered myself technically savvy, I didn't consider switching to a technically-focused career until after 8 years of HR and Recruiting. After hearing several success stories from friends and acquaintances, I realized I needed to see if I was cut out for it myself. 6 months later, I graduated from a Full Stack Developer boot camp at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>. In October of 2020, I landed my first professional role as a JavaScript Developer at a flight simulation start-up.</p>

                    My journey into software development has corrected two misunderstandings I had about programming:</p>
                   
                        <ol>
                            <li>There's a whole lot more room for creativity than I had previously imagined.</li>
                            <li>You don't have to be a mathematical genius for the majority of coding projects.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><u>My Experience</u></p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.25rem;">My experience can be hard to quantify because I have been using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript somewhat sporadically over the course of many years. For instance, I used HTML on a part time basis as webmaster of an online club from 2006-2010, in high school. And from 2017-2018 I attempted to monetize a website I made from scratch (ie. LocalPlacesWith) with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've tried to provide rough estimates which reflect my knowledge and confidence level, I hope you'll find this information helpful!</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><u>Self-Sufficiency</u></p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.25rem;">Another discovery I've made while programming, both during my coding boot camp and my time with TakeFlight, was how much programming reinforces one's ability to be self-sufficient. There won't always be someone to show you how to do something and, in programming, you will often find yourself in a situation where you must research and solve whatever issue you're facing on your own. This is an incredible gift and I am very grateful for the newfound love for exploration and self-sufficiency that programming has instilled in me.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><u>The Future</u></p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.25rem;">Moving forward, I have realized I have always been and continue to be most interested in the front-end side of things. In the long run, I would like to make moves to transition over to a focus on this type of work on a daily basis. However, I know I have much to learn, so in the meantime I am attempting to keep my front end skills sharp by taking on new freelance work wherever I can find it.</p>
