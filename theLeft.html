    What I admire about the Left, and my Left-leaning friends:<br>
    <br>
• The Left is open to new ideas.<br>
• The Left is an advocate for mercy and forgiveness.<br>
• The Left understands that all voices should be considered.<br>
• The Left understands that safety and mental health are important.<br>
• The Left believes in listening to each person's individual story before casting judgment.<br>
• The Left is often the first to notice potential areas for improvement in our society.<br>
• The Left seeks to build a society where no one is overlooked and every person is taken care of.<br>
• The Left believes in the ‘separation of church and state’ and that each person should be able to live in whatever manner they deem best, so long as they do no harm to others.<br>
<br>
Of course, just like the Right, we can point out moments of hypocrisy.. but there are hypocrites of every affiliation - every religion and every political party. At the end of the day though, these are the things that resonate with me most when I listen to the concerns of my Left-leaning friends.<br>
